# Prompt Co-Pilot — Feature Brief & Action Checklist  

> **Purpose**  
> Turn the static chat box into a context-aware workspace that refines prompts *before* they hit the model—cutting retries, saving tokens, and boosting answer quality.

---

## 1 · Why This Matters  

| Challenge | Consequence | Co-Pilot Fix |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Users iterate through “prompt roulette.” | Time lost, token burn, frustration. | Real-time refinement ends blind iteration. |
| Ambiguous / long prompts reduce precision. | Hallucinations, off-target replies, follow-ups. | Guided sharpening & distillation make intent clear. |
| Novice users struggle to phrase domain questions. | Steep learning curve, poor adoption. | One-click “expertise templates” raise the floor for everyone. |

---

## 2 · Core UX Flow  

1. **Type Prompt** – user starts typing.  
2. **Open ✨ Menu** – hover/click surfaces refinement actions.  
3. **Select Action(s)** – prompt rewrites inline with diff highlight.  
4. **Undo / Compare** – one-tap **Revert** or view 5-step history.  
5. **Send** – only when satisfied does text reach the LLM.

---

## 3 · One-Click Actions Library  

| Action | What It Does | Typical Use-Case |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Sharpen ↗** | Tightens language, removes filler, strengthens verbs. | Exec summaries, pro-email tone. |
| **Expand ＋** | Adds missing context or clarifying details. | Research queries, grant proposals. |
| **Distill ↓** | Compresses to core question, strips redundancy. | Quick FAQs, mobile prompts. |
| **Tone / Style** | Rewrites to Formal, Casual, Persuasive, etc. | Marketing copy, academic writing. |
| **Structure** | Formats as list, table, JSON, or code scaffold. | Dev tasks, README stubs. |

> _All powered locally via a lightweight `/refine` worker; falls back to server if needed._

---

## 4 · Advanced Controls  

- **Custom Macro Builder** – chain actions, save as “Bug Report Generator,” trigger with shortcut.  
- **Smart Defaults** – remembers preferred action order per user (local only).  
- **Accessibility / i18n** – keyboard-first, ARIA-labelled, high-contrast diff, RTL-aware motion.

---

## 5 · Under-the-Hood Design  

| Layer | Key Tech / Constraint |
|-------|-----------------------|
| UI Component | React + Tailwind (≤ 2 kB gz). |
| Client Logic | Web-Worker running MiniLLM (3-5 B params). |
| API Fallback | `/v1/refine` (same auth as `/chat`). |
| Security | Drafts stay local until user hits *Send*. |
| Telemetry | `hashed_action_id` + latency only (no prompt text). |

---

## 6 · Roll-out Plan  

| Phase | Milestone | Success Metric |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | Prototype behind feature-flag; dogfood. | ≥ 75 % “keep enabled.” |
| 1 | Limited Beta (10 % traffic). | ↓ 25 % avg prompt iterations. |
| 2 | GA + Macro Builder. | CSAT +0.4; “bad-answer” tickets −15 %. |

---

## 7 · Risks & Mitigations  

| Risk | Impact | Safeguard |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Over-refinement changes intent. | Frustration, distrust. | Always show diff + instant Revert. |
| Added UI clutter. | Cognitive overload. | ✨ icon hidden until ≥ 10 chars or `/`. |
| Latency on low-end devices. | Sluggish feel. | Debounce; server-refine fallback < 150 ms. |

---

## 8 · Design Critique → Fix Punch-List  

| # | Core Issue | Priority Fixes |
|---|------------|---------------|
| **1** | Unbalanced layout / wasted right-rail | ① Give right rail **History / Preview** role ② Symmetric 72 px rails ③ Top-right collapse toggle. |
| **2** | No clear visual hierarchy | ① Full-width glowing prompt bar ② Suggestion chips inside field, muted tones ③ Drag-card 50 % opacity until hover. |
| **3** | Ambiguous iconography | ① 300 ms tooltips ② First-load hint ③ Single icon set (Lucide); standard positions. |
| **4** | Low contrast greys | ① 3-tier elevation palette ② Brand accent on active elements ③ WCAG 4.5:1 audit. |

---

## 9 · Mock State Flow  

1. **Startup** – Left & right rails icon-only; canvas dominates; prompt bar bottom-center.  
2. **Input Focus** – Chips slide in; rails stay collapsed.  
3. **File Hover** – Canvas border animates brand accent; drop-card pops to 100 % opacity.  
4. **Preview Mode** – Right rail auto-expands to 280 px; left stays collapsed.

---

## 10 · One-Week Implementation Todo List  

- [ ] **Day 1:** Establish 8-pt grid; define CSS vars for elevation + accent.  
- [ ] **Day 2:** Refactor layout → `grid-template-columns: 72px 1fr 72px`; add rail collapse toggles.  
- [ ] **Day 3:** Build new prompt-bar component with inline chips + diff animation.  
- [ ] **Day 4:** Swap all icons to Lucide; implement hover tooltips and first-load hint.  
- [ ] **Day 5:** Run WCAG contrast checks; smoke-test flows; ship under feature flag to staging.

# **OpenUI: Project Recovery & Enhancement Plan**

> **Document Version:** 2.0  
> **Date:** July 8, 2025  
> **Status:** Final. Approved for immediate implementation.

-----

### **1. Executive Summary**

The OpenUI project is at a critical juncture. While its core vision of creating a next-generation AI interface is sound, a significant gap exists between the planned features and the current state of implementation. Key functionalities, including the dynamic **Prompt Co-Pilot**, are non-operational, leading to a disjointed user experience and stalled progress.

This document outlines a decisive **Recovery and Enhancement Plan** to bridge this gap. The plan prioritizes stabilizing the foundational architecture, implementing core features in a phased approach, and establishing rigorous quality standards.

By executing this plan, we will transform OpenUI into a robust, intuitive, and market-leading platform. We project a **50% reduction in user error rates** and a **30% increase in task completion speed**, delivering a product that is not only functional but also delightful to use. This document is the single source of truth for all project activities moving forward.

### **2. Strategic Vision: The Prompt Co-Pilot**

The central innovation of OpenUI is the **Prompt Co-Pilot**, a feature designed to evolve the static input field into a dynamic, intelligent workspace.

| Strategic Challenge | Business Consequence | The Co-Pilot Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Users engage in "prompt roulette." | Wasted time, increased token costs, and high user frustration. | Real-time refinement actions end the cycle of blind iteration. |
| Ambiguous or verbose prompts reduce precision. | Risk of hallucinations, off-target replies, and needless follow-ups. | Guided **Sharpening** & **Distillation** tools ensure user intent is unmistakable. |
| Novice users struggle with domain-specific phrasing. | Steep learning curve leading to poor feature adoption and churn. | One-click actions and templates provide "scaffolded expertise," raising the quality floor for all users. |

-----

### **3. Current State Analysis: Identified Implementation Gaps**

A recent code audit revealed critical deficiencies. The following table contrasts the intended design with the on-ground reality, forming the basis of our recovery roadmap.

| Intended Feature (from Project Brief) | Current Status (Code Review) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Floating & Dynamic Chat Input** | The chat input is static and not implemented as a floating component. |
| **Core Button Functionality** | **Send Button:** Lacks essential visual feedback (e.g., loading states).\<br\>**Clear Button:** Functionality is entirely missing. |
| **Prompt History & Management** | **Rail Toggle:** The history panel's visibility state does not persist.\<br\>**Item Actions:** No functionality to reuse, edit, or delete history items. |
| **Settings Panel & Persistence** | **Implementation:** The panel is a stub; most settings are not implemented.\<br\>**Persistence:** User settings do not save between sessions. |
| **Prompt Refinement Tools** | **Core Actions:** None of the core actions (**Sharpen, Expand, Distill, etc.**) are implemented. |
| **Accessibility & Keyboard Navigation**| **Shortcuts:** Keyboard shortcuts are incomplete.\<br\>**Screen Reader:** Critical ARIA attributes are missing from interactive elements. |

### **4. The Recovery & Enhancement Plan**

This section details the specific technical and design improvements required to rectify the issues and elevate the product.

#### **4.1. UI/UX Enhancements**

| Component | Issues Identified | Recommended Fixes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layout & Structure** | Unbalanced layout; no mobile consideration. | 1. Implement symmetric, collapsible side rails (72px width).\<br\>2. The right rail will serve a dual function for **History & Preview**.\<br\>3. Define and implement responsive breakpoints for tablet and mobile. |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | Unclear information architecture; low contrast. | 1. Establish a consistent 3-tier elevation system for visual depth.\<br\>2. Apply brand accent color to all primary interactive elements.\<br\>3. Enforce **WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1** for all text. |
| **Iconography & Affordance** | Inconsistent icon set; ambiguous elements. | 1. Standardize the entire application on the **Lucide icon set**.\<br\>2. Implement 300ms-delay tooltips on all icon-only buttons.\<br\>3. Add first-use "coach marks" to guide users to new features. |

#### **4.2. Technical Architecture Improvements**

| Area | Issues Identified | Recommended Fixes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Structure**| Disorganized components; excessive prop drilling. | 1. Reorganize components into a logical structure: `/features`, `/common`, `/ui`.\<br\>2. Implement **React's Context API** for global state management.\<br\>3. Use component composition to reduce deep prop drilling. |
| **State Management** | Unstructured local state; no server state solution. | 1. Utilize **React Query** to manage server state, caching, and mutations.\<br\>2. Create distinct, well-defined domains for global client state.\<br\>3. Implement robust **Error Boundaries** around key application features. |

#### **4.3. Developer Experience & Quality Standards**

| Focus | Current State | Improvement Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Documentation** | Sparse and inconsistent. | 1. Enforce **JSDoc comment blocks** for all components and functions.\<br\>2. Create architectural diagrams using Mermaid.js within the repository.\<br\>3. Document all API contracts using **Swagger/OpenAPI**. |
| **Code Quality & Testing** | Limited test coverage; inconsistent formatting. | 1. Implement **Jest** for unit tests and **React Testing Library** for components.\<br\>2. Configure **ESLint and Prettier** with strict rules, enforced by **Husky pre-commit hooks**.\<br\>3. Introduce **Storybook** for isolated component development and visual testing. |

-----

### **5. Prioritized Implementation Roadmap**

The project will proceed in three distinct phases, with clear milestones to ensure measurable progress.

#### **Phase 1: Foundations & Core Functionality (Weeks 1-2)**

  * **Tasks:** Implement the 8-point grid system, collapsible rails, and responsive breakpoints. Set up Context API and React Query. Build the floating chat input with functional Send/Clear buttons. Configure CI/CD, linting, and pre-commit hooks.
  * **Phase 1 Milestone:** A stable, responsive application skeleton is deployed to a staging environment, with a functional core chat interface.

#### **Phase 2: Feature Implementation (Weeks 3-4)**

  * **Tasks:** Implement history panel actions (reuse, delete) and settings persistence. Build the UI for the refinement menu and implement the `Sharpen` & `Distill` actions. Document APIs with OpenAPI and write unit/integration tests for all new features.
  * **Phase 2 Milestone:** Core user features (History, Settings, basic Prompt Refinement) are fully functional and test-covered in the staging environment.

#### **Phase 3: Polish & Hardening (Weeks 5-6)**

  * **Tasks:** Implement remaining refinement actions (`Expand`, `Tone`, `Structure`). Conduct a full accessibility audit (keyboard navigation, ARIA, screen readers) and remediate all findings. Profile application performance and optimize bottlenecks.
  * **Phase 3 Milestone:** The application is feature-complete, WCAG AA compliant, and performance-tuned. Ready for a limited beta release.
